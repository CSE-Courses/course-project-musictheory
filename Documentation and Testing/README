Guide for Task Testing

As of right now there are two documents in this folder which can be used to test the front end of our website.

These files are MT-Tests.side and Selenium IDE - MT-Tests_.html.

1. MT-Tests.side

The .side folder can be open using the Selenium IDE browser extension which can be found here : https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/selenium-ide/mooikfkahbdckldjjndioackbalphokd?hl=en

As far as we know the extension is only available on Google Chrome.

After installation you can open the file with the tests inside and test the website on localhost:3000 after using the command "node app.js". To free the port afterwards you can use the command "fuser -k -n tcp 3000".

2. If you don't want to use the extension, you can simply open the html file which already has all of the results of the tests.
